Description:

It is a working, functioning, visual Tic Tac Toe game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that is simple to learn but offers strategic depth. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where each player takes turns marking a cell with their symbol, either "X" or "O". The objective is to be the first to align three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. Despite its simplicity, Tic Tac Toe involves critical thinking and foresight as players must anticipate their opponent's moves and strategize to block them while creating their winning opportunities.

In this Python implementation, the game is played in the terminal using ASCII art to visually represent the board. The board is displayed with each cell separated by vertical bars (`|`), and horizontal lines (`-`) are used to divide the rows. Players take turns inputting their chosen row and column numbers to place their symbols. The program checks for a winner after each turn by evaluating rows, columns, and diagonals for three matching symbols. If all cells are filled without any player achieving this, the game ends in a draw. The code handles input validation and provides feedback if a player tries to occupy an already filled cell, ensuring a smooth and fair gameplay experience. This terminal-based version retains the essence of the traditional game while leveraging the simplicity and elegance of ASCII art.
